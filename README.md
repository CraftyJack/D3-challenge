# D3-challenge
This is an interactive graph using D3. Screenshots are included below, and it really is helpful to interact with the live page here:

Multiple health-related variables are shown on the y-axis, while age/income-related variables are shown on the x-axis.Clicking on the axis labels changes the feature displayed on that axis.

The objects (states) move in transition, which helps to give a sense of how rankings in one fature translate to rankings in another, and also to highlight any jumps in ranking. Mousing over a state's circle brings up a tooltip populated with data appropirate to the currently selected axes. (e.g. if the currently selected axes are 'obesity' and 'poverty', then the tooltip will include 'obesity' and 'poverty' values for the point selected.)
